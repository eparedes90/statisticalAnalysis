# Tesis&Analisis: data analysis for your research

## Project Motivation

Tesis&Analisis was created to help researchers extract, clean, and analyze the data of their research projects. 
In this repository, you would find carpets of some projects of extraction and analysis of data. Some of them do not have a complete explanation for business purposes.

## Installations

It is needed to have R and Python and the libraries cited inside the files. 

## File Description

* Inside Python projects you will find a Jupyter Notebook and the data (in .csv). Right now is just one project in .py named 'savingRetirement'.

* Inside R projects the carpets are subdivided into the following carpets:
    * Data: raw data
    * For Analysis: Cleaned data
    * Plots: Graphs and tables
    * Script: Files in Rmd or txt to read in RStudio
    * If you want to see the statistical report you will need to go to the .pdf file with the same name as the carpet inside of it.
