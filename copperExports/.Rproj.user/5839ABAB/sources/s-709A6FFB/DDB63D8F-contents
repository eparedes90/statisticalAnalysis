## Data

The source of the data is "Encuesta Nacional de Demanda de Servicios Financieros y Nivel de Cultura Financiera en el Perú" provided by Superintendencia de Banca y Seguros (SBS)

The regions selected were Lima and Callao. The sample was reduced to all the interviewed who are heads of a household. 

### Variables definition

- Savings: (Dichotomic variable) Cases are the ones who answered in the question "p_55" the options from 1 to 6; Control, 7 and 8. In other words, Cases are the people who are saving money when they get old (or retired), while Controls are not saving money. 

- Age: (Numeric variable) Question "p_3". 

- Education: (Ordered variable) Question "p_8". The ones who marked the option 1 they do not have education, and were assigned the rank "0"; option 2, just kindergarten education, and were assigned the rank "1"; option 3 and 4, primary education with rank "2"; option 5 and 6, secondary education with rank "3", the rest of options, superior education with rank "4".

- Marital Status: (Categorical variable) Question "p_4". 

- Sex: (Dichotomic variable) Question "p_2". Men were assigned "0" and Women, "1". 

- Income: (Ordered variable) Question "p_27". People who earned less than 400 soles were assigned "0"; more or equal than 400 soles and less than 750 soles, "1"; more or equal than 750 soles and less than 1500 soles, "2"; more or equal than 1500 soles, "3".

- NumMembersAtHome: (Numeric Variable). Question "p_5". Number of people who live in the household.
